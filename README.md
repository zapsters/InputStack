Modules will slowly spawn and requires you, and or your friends, to manage multiple modules at once. Modules can be simple math to unscambling a word or even just keeping a slider up. All modules have some form of input such as an input box, a button, or anything else.'

Multiplayer works by syncing all input fields to each other, so one person's change will sync to everyone else in the same game. 

Database is ran in Google Firebase.
